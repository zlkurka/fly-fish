# Ideas for future changes
## Modifications
### Sorted inventory
- Categories for fish, powerups, materials, etc.
- Displays money.
### Main menu
- Only display options that are possible for player (e.g., no travel option if player only has one location unlocked).
- Merge shop and sell fish into Market.
### Go Fishing
- Move "change fly" option from main menu.
### Inventory
- Make flies global?
## Additions
### Market
What if it was inspired by the Pike Place Market? Idk how but that'd be cool.
#### Buying
- Randomly determine what is in stock (location-based).
- Can buy other fish?
#### Selling
- Uses dictionary to match fish to prices.
- "Sell all" option.
- Variability in sell-prices (proportional or within a range).
- Location-based sell-price variability.
### Powerups
- Add powerups option to Go Fish.
- Sake: increases "fishing power".
- Will probably need to be global.
### Crafting
- Can craft fish into other items (flies, powerups, etc.).
### Story
#### NPCs
- The Fisherman.
- Market NPCs.
- The Fishmonger? (taking design inspo from the underscores album would be funny).
Would need to be location-based.
### Minigames
- Go-fish.
- A dungeon-crawler (it would be funny).
