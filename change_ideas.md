# Ideas for future changes
## Modifications
### Main menu
- Only display options that are possible for player (e.g., no travel option if player only has one `location` unlocked).
### Market
- Variability in sell-prices (proportional or within a range).
- Location-based sell-price variability.
### Time
Right now, you can just fish forever and refresh a shop just by returning to the menu. I need days to pass, and for that I need there to be a cost for time passing, which is probably food or the encroach of doom.
## Additions
### Market
What if it was inspired by the Pike Place Market? Idk how but that'd be cool.
#### Fishmonger
- Only allow buying of fish from locations the player has unlocked? Maybe I can use the list of each fish type the player has caught for this
### Powerups
- Figure out powerup merchant
- **Dissolving melatonin**: makes fish sleepy (more able to catch with a net?).
### Crafting
- Can craft **fish** into other items (**flies**, **powerups**, etc.).
- **Suspicious fish** have a chance for bonus crafting materials
### Journal
Contains a list of each fish type you've caught (and maybe on what day?)
### Minigames
#### Dangerous fish
- May need items to defend against some fish.
- If you're farming for something and keep catching small but dangerous fish, I don't want you to have to play a minigame over and over. Maybe I could do something similar to "He is Coming" where it's an autobattler and you can just skip the encounter and get the outcomes.
#### Go Fish
- You receive around 5 fish from the current location pool, then trade off asking each other for fish. If the other player does not have a matching fish, do one **Fishing** cycle.
### Story
My vision for the point-and-click version has a horror undertone involving monsters of the deep and such. I'd like to incorporate some of that here.
#### Locations
I currently have two locations: **The Dells** and **Chicago**. However, it might be cool to have different locations around a certain area (a river, a lake), so you can still return to the same **Market** and develop relationships (or at least familiarity) with the NPCs. 
#### NPCs
- **The Fisherman**: 
  - This character was the main inspiration for this game. I had an idea for a diaglogue-based RPG with three characters who would die soon. My favorite was the fisherman, so I decided to design a game specifically for him.
  - The Fisherman is the father or father-figure of the main character.
  - He has a sort of disease-like relationship to fishing, something something horror elements. The activity takes something from him, and he passes this down to the MC (something something cancer allegory).
- **The Fishmonger**
  - Secret: can eventually unlock the ability to play **Go Fish** with him. I'll need to make the Fishmonger interesting enough to encourage players to interact with him.
  - Is secretly some sort of angler fish guy. I'll figure it out.
- **The Drink Lady**
  - This is a filler name for an NPC who will sell **Sake** and **Coffee grounds**, and maybe some other powerups. I need to figure out who and how I want her to be.
- Other market NPCs.

Would need to be location-based.
# Next steps
- Clean up code all over the place (simplify variables, revisit organization, avoid pyramid structure?)
## Powerups
- Add **Sake** and **Coffee grounds**.
