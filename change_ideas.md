# Ideas for future changes
## Modifications
### Market
- Proportional variability in sell-prices.
- What if it was inspired by the Pike Place Market? Idk how but that'd be cool.
#### Fishmonger
- Only allow buying of fish from locations the player has unlocked? Maybe I can use the list of each fish type the player has caught for this.
## Additions
### Time
Right now, you can just fish forever and refresh a shop just by returning to the main menu. I need days to pass, and for that I need there to be a cost for time passing, which is probably food and/or the encroach of doom.
### Powerups
- **Dissolving melatonin**: makes fish sleepy? (I'm not really sure what this would do)
### Crafting
- Can craft **fish** into other items (**flies**, **powerups**, etc.).
- Need recipes from the Fisherman to craft flies.
- Need recipes to craft anything? You can probably tear apart a fish by yourself, or maybe after your first fishing session the Fisherman teaches you how to skin/clean/whatever a fish and you get the recipe.
- **Suspicious fish** have a chance for bonus crafting materials (e.g. hooks).
Recipes
- Gold fish -> gold flakes
- Fish (+ fire?) -> food
- What if you could get a bell and combine it with some hooks to make an awesome bell hooks reference? I feel like I'm not familiar enough with her work to do that
### Journal
Contains a list of each fish type you've caught (and maybe on what day?).
### Minigames
#### Dangerous fish
- May need items to defend against some fish.
- If you're farming for something and keep catching small but dangerous fish, I don't want you to have to play a minigame over and over. Maybe I could do something similar to "He is Coming" where it's an autobattler and you can just skip the encounter and get the outcomes.
#### Go Fish
- You receive around 5 fish from the current location pool, then trade off asking each other for fish. If the other player does not have a matching fish, do one **Fishing** cycle.
### Story
My vision for the point-and-click version has a horror undertone involving monsters of the deep and such. I'd like to incorporate some of that here.
#### Locations
I currently have two locations: **The Dells** and **Chicago**. However, it might be cool to have different locations around a certain area (a river, a lake), so you can still return to the same **Market** and develop relationships (or at least familiarity) with the NPCs. 
#### NPCs
- **The Fisherman**: 
  - The player receives their first fly from the Fisherman, and they get the crafting recipes for the rest of their flies from him, probably after some significant interactions.
  - This character was the main inspiration for this game. I had an idea for a diaglogue-based RPG with three characters who would die soon. My favorite was the fisherman, so I decided to design a game specifically for him.
  - The Fisherman is the father or father-figure of the main character. He has a sort of disease-like relationship to fishing, something something horror elements. The activity takes something from him, and he passes this down to the MC (something something cancer allegory).
- **The Fishmonger**
  - Secret: can eventually unlock the ability to play **Go Fish** with him. I'll need to make the Fishmonger interesting enough to encourage players to interact with him.
  - Is secretly some sort of angler fish guy. I'll figure it out.
- **The Drink Lady**
  - This is a filler name for an NPC who will sell **Sake** and **Coffee grounds**, and maybe some other powerups. I need to figure out who and how I want her to be.
  - A sweet older Italian lady :)
- Other market NPCs.
### Nick shit
- during the early morning and at night, larger fish are closer to the surface, whereas in the midday they're clsoer to the water

Would need to be location-based.
# Next steps
- ADD CRAFTING!!!
- Add super rare and legendary fish to pools where needed.
