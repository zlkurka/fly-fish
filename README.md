# Fly-Fishing Simulator

Here is the code for my fly-fishing simulator game. I want to make a bigger, story-rich point-and-click game, but I'm starting with something smaller since I'm a beginner, kinda.

The game currently runs when executed through a code editing software. I don't really know if that's the right way to explain it. I just run my code in VS Code and I can play the game. You understand.

The code is executed from "fly_fishing_sim.py". Idk if this is how people normally organize these things

So! What can you do in this "game"?
- You can go fly fishing! That's probably the most important part
- You can sell your fish! They will cost a constant amount, which may be subject to change. Rarer fish are worth more.
- You can buy powerups and use them to improve your fishing abilities, including your cast time, your chance of catching a fish, and the rarity of the fish you catch. The latter is the only way you can catch the (partly implemented) legendary-tier fish! Ooooo
- You can buy more fish! Why would you want to do that?
- You can look at the options to change your location and equipped fly and wonder why you only have one choice! I'm working on it!
- You can enter "dev" at the first input prompt to unlock each fly and location, give you one of each fish and a bunch of each powerup, and give you more money than you'll ever need. Yippee!
