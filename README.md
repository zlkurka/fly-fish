# Fly-Fishing Simulator

Here is the code for my fly-fishing simulator game. 
I want to make a bigger, story-rich point-and-click game, 
but I'm starting with something smaller since I'm a beginner, kinda.

The game currently runs when executed through a code editing software. 
I don't really know if that's the right way to explain it. 
I just run my code in VS Code and I can play the game. You understand.
