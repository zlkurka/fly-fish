Here is the code for my fly-fishing simulator game. It's a smaller version of a bigger, story-rich point-and-click game. 

The game currently runs when executed through a code editing software. 
I don't really know if that's the right way to explain it. 
I just run my code in VS Code and I can play the game. You understand.
